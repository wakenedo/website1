                    Self-taught programmer, that means, really, always learning from others, dedicated and passionate about technology.
Always open to learn and improve. On a journey of self-development and improving as a software-developer.
I'm a very organized, communicative and curious individual. I like being part of team and achieve objectives
together, organizing strategies as each team member contributes with his abilities and experieces to deal 
with problems, issues and solutions can be a lot of fun and very rewarding as a growth experience. 
                        <br /> Being part of a team is extremely important to develop skills, teams are able to provide insights that you 
could never access alone. I actually found out I love to learn and researching, and since I was born in the 
early 90s and happened to see the technology boom we had in our lives, and how that affected every aspect
of our lives I was naturaly draw to it. Currently Im lookign to switch from freelancing to full position as a 
software developer, I'm not afraid of starting from the bottom, and working my way up. As I've stated before, 
I love learning, and I realise that the skills of being a freelancer might not be as usefull or alingned with 
what I'm looking for. So im open to join a team and learn as much as I can, and bringing to table my experience, skills and undivided
attention to the project. If you wanna have a talk, and thinks my profile fits you're position lets have a chat.
